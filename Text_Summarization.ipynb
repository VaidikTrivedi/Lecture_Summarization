certification, where a person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an examination and/or the completion of a program of study. Some professional certifications also require that one obtain work experience in a related field before the certification can be awarded. Some professional certifications are valid for a lifetime upon completing all certification requirements. Others expire after a certain period of time and have to be maintained with further education and/or testing. Certifications can differ within a profession by the level or specific area of expertise to which they refer. For example, in the IT Industry there are different certifications available for software tester, project manager, and developer. Also, the Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology offers three certifications in the same profession, but with increasing complexity. Certification does not designate that a person has sufficient knowledge in a subject area, only that they passed the test. Certification does not refer to the state of legally being able to practice or work in a profession. That is licensure. Usually, licensure is administered by a governmental entity for public protection purposes and a professional association administers certification. Licensure and certification are similar in that they both require the demonstration of a certain level of knowledge or ability. Another common type of certification in modern society is product certification. This refers to processes intended to determine if a product meets minimum standards, similar to quality assurance. Different certification systems exist in each country. For example, in Russia it is the GOST R Rostest.

In second-party certification, an association to which the individual or organization belongs provides the assurance.[5] Third-party certification involves an independent assessment declaring that specified requirements pertaining to a product, person, process, or management system have been met.[6] In this respect, a Notified Body is a third-party, accredited body which is entitled by an accreditation body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accreditation body may allow a Notified body to provide third-party certification and testing services.

For exam-based certifications the candidate must pass an exam, which can also be learned by self-study. For example, for International Software Testing Qualifications Board Certified Tester by the International Software Testing Qualifications Board[9] or Certified Software Tester by QAI or Certified Software Quality Engineer by American Society for Quality. Education-based certifications are the instructor-led sessions, where each course has to be passed.

Launched in 2004, and designed by a Kijiji freelancer, CDL’s website was never fully integrated into any business strategy or plan. Its content presented general information about CDL’s medical imaging products, with a specific focus on a product line that CDL no longer offers.  Years have passed with no attention being paid to the site or the impact that this site has had on potential customers.  CDL’s accounting department pays the hosting invoice, and the domain registration fees annually. No one knows the hosting site login username and password now. A recent, informal survey of current and prospective clients has revealed that those who did visit CDL’s website simply did not take the company seriously or were confused as to what the corporate activities CDL was engaged in as an organization. Some of CDL’s senior management are starting to be concerned about their corporate image, as CDL strives to salvage the TrackR product line, and their attempt to enlarge their customer base.  This partially is a result of the regular (3 times per week) meetings that they are holding now, due to the implementation of the CDL Executive Dashboard. CDL’s Marketing VP and IT Director delivered the message, with some accompanying facts, that there’s a lot of Internet and Social Media content regarding CDL, but CDL has no official presence in the Web! CDL’s website is so out-of-date that it is now damaging the brand.  Progressive customers of CDL’s profitable business division, Medical Imaging, have been asking for elementary e-commerce systems now for at least one year.  Of course, the marketing staff are eager and ready to start a new website, to at least keep up to the competition. CDL’s TrackR App Upgrade project has established an official presence on one of the major social media channels. The development team’s regular reports are showing others some of the early benefits from this.\"\n","#with open(\"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Demo3.txt\", 'r', encoding=\"latin-1\") as file:\n","raw_text = \"One of the most common types of certification in modern society is professional certification, where a person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an examination and/or the completion of a program of study.

of the most common types of certification in modern society is professional certification, where a person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an examination and/or the completion of a program of study. Some professional certifications also require that one obtain work experience in a related field before the certification can be awarded. Some professional certifications are valid for a lifetime upon completing all certification requirements. Others expire after a certain period of time and have to be maintained with further education and/or testing. Certifications can differ within a profession by the level or specific area of expertise to which they refer. For example, in the IT Industry there are different certifications available for software tester, project manager, and developer. Also, the Joint Commission on Allied Health Personnel in Ophthalmology offers three certifications in the same profession, but with increasing complexity. Certification does not refer to the state of legally being able to practice or work in a profession. Usually, licensure is administered by a governmental entity for public protection purposes and a professional association administers certification. Licensure and certification are similar in that they both require the demonstration of a certain level of knowledge or ability. Another common type of certification in modern society is product certification. This refers to processes intended to determine if a product meets minimum standards, similar to quality assurance. Different certification systems exist in each country. For example, in Russia it is the GOST R Rostest. In second-party certification, an association to which the individual or organization belongs provides the assurance.[5] Third-party certification involves an independent assessment declaring that specified requirements pertaining to a product, person, process, or management system have been met.[6] In this respect, a Notified Body is a third-party, accredited body which is entitled by an accreditation body. Upon definition of standards and regulations, the accreditation body may allow a Notified body to provide third-party certification and testing services. All that ensures and assesses compliance to the previously-defined codes but also to provide an official certification mark or a declaration of conformity.[7][8] In software testing For software testing, the certifications can be grouped into exam-based and education-based. Education-based certifications are the instructor-led sessions, where each course has to be passed.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":170},"id":"a2VT4Lctl2--","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617574787216,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":35576,"user":{"displayName":"Vaidik Trivedi","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgWM0cj_10V2z3J9b2FSjODG6X4N1XgP4rMADPtoA=s64","userId":"05108778346405444966"}},"outputId":"d9e23780-58f0-40bb-c7ab-a027398ec45d"},"source":["result_2 = model(data, num_sentences=10, min_length=3)\n","print(len(result_2))\n","result_2"],"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1398\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'One of the most common types of certification in modern society is professional certification, where a person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or task, usually by the passing of an examination and/or the completion of a program of study.
